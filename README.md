# OOPS Concepts Practice & Employee Management System

This repository contains practical JavaScript examples for all major Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts, along with a complete Employee Management System project demonstrating these concepts in a real-world scenario.

## Contents

### 1. OOPS Concepts Practice

- **Inheritance Practice**
  - `employee.js` – Simple inheritance example with Employee classes.
  - `student.js` – Inheritance with Student and StudentDetails classes.

- **Polymorphism**
  - `Polymorphism/script.js` – Demonstrates method overriding and polymorphism with basic animal classes.

- **Abstraction**
  - `Abstraction/script.js` – Shows abstraction using base and derived classes (e.g., Shape and Circle).

### 2. Employee Management System Project

A modern, responsive Employee Portal built with JavaScript and Bootstrap 5, demonstrating OOPS concepts in a practical application.

- **Features:**
  - Modern dark UI with glassmorphism and sidebar navigation
  - Employee data table: view, filter, edit, and delete employees
  - Add employee/company forms
  - Company filter
  - Responsive design
  - Clean OOPS-based code

- **Files:**
  - `Inheritance Project Employee-Company/index.html` – Dashboard & Employee Data Table
  - `Inheritance Project Employee-Company/addEmployee.html` – Add Employee/Company Page
  - `Inheritance Project Employee-Company/employee.js` – Employee table logic
  - `Inheritance Project Employee-Company/addNew.js` – Add employee/company logic
  - `Inheritance Project Employee-Company/style.css` – Custom styles

## How to Use

1. Explore the practice folders (`Inheritance Practice`, `Polymorphism`, `Abstraction`) for simple OOPS examples.
2. Open `Inheritance Project Employee-Company/index.html` in your browser to use the Employee Management System.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5)
- Bootstrap Icons
- LocalStorage for data persistence

## Educational Purpose

This repository is intended for learning and practicing OOPS concepts in JavaScript, as well as understanding how to apply them in a real project.
